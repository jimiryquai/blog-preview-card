# Project Overview: Blog Preview Card

## Project Information

**Project Name**: Blog Preview Card  
**Type**: Frontend Component Challenge  
**Source**: Frontend Mentor  
**Complexity**: Beginner  
**Author**: James (with SuperClaude Frontend, Architect, and Scribe personas)

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. Build a responsive blog preview card component matching the provided design
2. Implement using modern CSS methodologies (CUBE CSS and Every Layout)
3. Demonstrate semantic HTML and accessibility best practices
4. Achieve responsive design without using media queries

### Learning Objectives
1. Master fundamental HTML elements and semantic markup
2. Apply CSS custom properties for design token management
3. Implement Every Layout patterns for robust layouts
4. Practice CUBE CSS methodology for scalable styling
5. Explore modern CSS features (clamp(), fluid typography)

## Constraints & Requirements

### Technical Constraints
- No media queries for responsive design
- Must use semantic HTML elements
- Font sizes should reduce on smaller screens
- Hover and focus states required for interactive elements

### Design Requirements
- Match the provided design as closely as possible
- Support screen sizes from 320px to large displays
- Maintain WCAG AA compliance
- Use Figtree font family (weights: 500, 800)

### Methodology Requirements
- CUBE CSS architecture (Composition, Utilities, Blocks, Exceptions)
- Every Layout patterns where applicable
- Design tokens as CSS custom properties
- BEM-like naming conventions for components

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- [ ] Component renders correctly across all screen sizes (320px+)
- [ ] Hover states work on all interactive elements
- [ ] Focus states are visible and accessible
- [ ] Content remains readable at all sizes

### Technical Success
- [ ] Valid, semantic HTML structure
- [ ] CUBE CSS methodology properly implemented
- [ ] Every Layout patterns used effectively
- [ ] No media queries in the CSS
- [ ] CSS custom properties for all design tokens

### Quality Success
- [ ] Passes HTML validation
- [ ] Passes CSS validation
- [ ] WCAG AA compliant
- [ ] Performance optimized (minimal CSS, efficient selectors)
- [ ] Code is well-documented and maintainable

## Technical Approach

### CSS Architecture: CUBE CSS
1. **Composition**: Layout primitives using Every Layout
2. **Utilities**: Design tokens and helper classes
3. **Blocks**: Component-specific styles
4. **Exceptions**: State-based modifications

### Every Layout Patterns
- **Center**: Page-level centering
- **Stack**: Vertical spacing system
- **Cluster**: Author information layout
- **Frame**: Image aspect ratio maintenance
- **Box**: Consistent padding system

### Modern CSS Features
- CSS Custom Properties for theming
- Clamp() for fluid typography
- HSL color notation
- Logical properties where applicable
- Modern units (rem, ch)
